# React Context Starter Template

This is a simple shop with a lot of `prop-drilling`! I therefore see it as the perfect starter template for using the React Context API.

- It is bootstrapped with Vite-React

## Extra CSS Packages

- Tailwind CSS
- Daisy UI

## How to use

- Click on the `Use this template` button **(located at the top right corner a little above the Code button)** to create a new repository from this template.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
